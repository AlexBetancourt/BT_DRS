I've been messing around with you program for about a half hour now and my first impression is that it is great at keeping track of armor 
and internal damage, and it is also very good at keeping track of heat and it's effects.
So as it stands it is very usable in those aspects, however, I would still need to have the paper records to use along with the program. 
The reason being is that in this version there doesn't appear to me to be a way to keep track of what weapons the 'Mech has on it. 
(Of course if I'm just blind and not seeing thing properly let me know) Also kinda tied into that, the critical hit tables don't seem 
to be working at the moment.
This also applies to the Mech Lab where it seems you can only assign things to the Head crit table and nothing else. 
So if I wanted to put a Medium Laser in the Center Torso the program wont let me. Also, the option for equipment in the 'Mech lab don't 
seem to go beyond single slot equipment.
Despite all of that I would like to reiterate that the programs capabilities to keep track of damage and heat are phenomenal.

And the quick access to all of the tables is really nice. Also I like the sound effects from the weapons fire and Bitchin' Betty. 
Which leads me to a question I have to ask. I saw in the sound folder in the directory that there were a lot of sounds from various MW games. 
So in the future will there be an option to change the sound effects that are used, like using MW2's Betty rather MW3's?
So great work I look forward to seeing your future developments on the program. I will keep messing around and see if I can't find 
anything else that might help you further improve your project. Or I might find out i'm a dummy and missed something.




Requires admin privileges right now. Is there any way to avoid that?

The program stalls if you try to do anything without privileges. After locking up and trying to load for a minute it does give an error 
message letting you know you can’t do anything, but it won’t let you do anything while it is trying.

Import Weapons and Equipment could be clearer. I can tell what it does, importing all of the weapons and mechs from the excel files, 
but it wasn’t clear that I should do that when I first opened the program and it wasn’t clear what it was doing while it was running. 
Consider a first time pop-up when the program opens with nothing in the catalogs asking if they want to import them.

Dice roll as a small window with buttons that displays the result immediately rather than as a separate pop-up
I like the Barracks, excellent addition. Need a way to import those mechwarriors into record sheets.
Mechlab doesn’t show weapons/criticals yet, I’m sure you know that.

Unclear how to import a mech from the mechlab onto a record sheet. Is the only way through the Mech Bay right now?

Show amount of heat you have accumulated as a number in addition to the bar

For heat modifiers, show the current penalty next to the abbreviations

The “Destroyed” alert that plays when a part is destroyed should probably specify what type of part was destroyed. 
Arm destroyed is significantly different than losing a torso.

Make arms no longer selectable for damage after the associated torso has been destroyed.

Consider adding a tracking of how much damage a mech has taken in a round for triggering piloting rolls. 
Then you can turn the Apply Heatsinks button into an End Turn button that applies heat sinks and resets the damage count.

Add a pilot hit when the heat is hit and add some kind of reminder that a consciousness check is needed.

Is saving and loading mech status currently disabled?

In the MechLab the “Load Mech” button doesn’t seem to do anything.

I think the internal structure is based on the tonnage on the tonnage of the mech. 
When designing a mech in the MechLab consider setting the internal structure values when you set the tonnage and prevent the 
player from altering them. I would need to check the construction rules to be sure.

The “Update” button on the MechLab doesn’t seem to work. It returned the following error when I tried to use 
it: “Invalid BSON data type ‘Null’ on field ‘_id’”

I assume the “Update” button should update the values recorded in the excel sheet. Consider combining it with the “Save Mech” button. 
Pressing the “Save Mech” button creates a new entry even if you already have a mech with the same Variant value.

Consider adding a “Remove” option on the MechLab. I currently have two Test Mechs in the excel file.

Restrict the tonnage to a multiple of 5.

Restrict the armor based on the underlying internal structure.
